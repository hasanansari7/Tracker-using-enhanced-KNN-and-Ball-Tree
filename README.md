Finding a missing person can be a daunting task, but with the help of technology, it can be made easier. By filing a First Information Report (FIR) at your local police station, the police can start their search and spread the word by sharing the missing person's photograph to other nearby police stations. But, this process can be time-consuming and manual. That's why we can make use of Facial Recognition technology to automate the process. With just a photo, the technology can search for a match in its database and help the police in their search for the missing person. This can save time and make the search process more efficient.
