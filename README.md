# Tracker-using-enhanced-KNN-and-Ball-Tree
Our project is about finding missing individuals. We use Image Processing, Machine Learning, and a database called Postgres to help us track them down. This technology helps us search for a match faster and more accurately. The database stores all the information we collect. The goal is to make finding missing people easier.
